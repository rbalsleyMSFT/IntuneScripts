Some parts of sites might not work) If you disable this policy or don't configure it, users can set their own level of tracking prevention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Enabled (Strict)                                                                       |

To control the availability of sync, use the 'SyncDisabled' (Disable synchronization of data using Microsoft sync services) policy instead. If you set this policy to 'Disable browser sign-in', make sure that you also set the 'NonRemovableProfileEnabled' (Configure whether a user always has a default profile automatically signed in with their work or school account) policy to disabled because 'NonRemovableProfileEnabled' disables the creation of an automatically signed in browser profile. If both policies are set, Microsoft Edge will use the 'Disable browser sign-in' policy and behave as if 'NonRemovableProfileEnabled' is set to disabled. If you set this policy to 'Enable browser sign-in' (1), users can sign into the browser. Signing into the browser doesn't mean that sync is turned on by default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature. If you set this policy to 'Force browser sign-in' (2) users must sign into a profile to use the browser. By default, this will allow the user to choose whether they want to sync to their account, unless sync is disabled by the domain admin or with the 'SyncDisabled' policy. The default value of 'BrowserGuestModeEnabled' (Enable guest mode) policy is set to false. If you don't configure this policy users can decide if they want to enable the browser sign-in option and use it as they see fit. * 0 = Disable browser sign-in * 1 = Enable browser sign-in * 2 = Force users to sign-in to use the browser                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Enabled > Browser sign-in settings (Device): Force users to sign-in to use the browser |

Do Not Track requests let the websites you visit know that you don't want your browsing activity to be tracked. By default, Microsoft Edge doesn't send Do Not Track requests, but users can turn on this feature to send them. If you enable this policy, Do Not Track requests are always sent to websites asking for tracking info. If you disable this policy, requests are never sent.

| Microsoft Edge\Configure whether a user always has a default profile automatically signed in with their work or school account | This policy determines if a user can remove the Microsoft Edge profile automatically signed in with a user's work or school account. If you enable this policy, a non-removable profile will be created with the user's work or school account on Windows. This profile can't be signed out or removed. If you disable or don't configure this policy, the profile automatically signed in with a user's work or school account on Windows can be signed out or removed by the user.

### Microsoft Edge Password Manager

**NOTE** the following password manager and protection settings are counter to securty best practices. The reason these are recommended has to do with students who may have issues with long/complex passwords. If this is the case for your students, set the below settings. If you disable Enable saving passwords to the password manager, the other three settings aren't needed. However if you want to allow Edge to save passwords, then the other three options might be useful if your students have issues with complex passwords.

Password protection alerts users when they reuse their protected password on potentially suspicious sites. You can use the 'PasswordProtectionLoginURLs' (Configure the list of enterprise login URLs where password protection service should capture fingerprint of password) and 'PasswordProtectionChangePasswordURL' (Configure the change password URL) policies to configure which passwords to protect. Exemptions: Passwords for the sites listed in 'PasswordProtectionLoginURLs' and 'PasswordProtectionChangePasswordURL', as well as for the sites listed in 'SmartScreenAllowListDomains' (Configure the list of domains for which Microsoft Defender SmartScreen won't trigger warnings), will not trigger a password-protection warning. Set to 'PasswordProtectionWarningOff' (0) to not show password protection warningss. Set to 'PasswordProtectionWarningOnPasswordReuse' (1) to show password protection warnings when the user reuses their protected password on a non-allowlisted site. If you disable or don't configure this policy, then the warning trigger is not shown. * 0 = Password protection warning is off. * 1 = Password protection warning is triggered by password reuse. | Enabled (Password protection warning is off) |

| OneDrive\Prevent users from syncing personal OneDrive accounts (User)                                                            | **Note** Even though this is flagged as a (User) policy, it will still apply when targeting to a group of devices. This setting lets you block users from signing in with a Microsoft account to sync their personal OneDrive files. If you enable this setting, users will be prevented from setting up a sync relationship for their personal OneDrive account. Users who are already syncing their personal OneDrive when you enable this setting won't be able to continue syncing (and will be shown a message that syncing has stopped), but any files synced to the computer will remain on the computer. If you disable or do not configure this setting, users can sync their personal OneDrive accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Enabled                                                                                                                      |
| OneDrive\Silently move Windows known folders to OneDrive                                                                         | This setting lets you redirect known folders to OneDrive without any user interaction. In sync app builds below 18.171.0823.0001, this setting only redirects empty known folders to OneDrive (or known folders already redirected to a different OneDrive account). In later builds, it redirects known folders that contain content and moves the content to OneDrive. We recommend using this setting together with "Prompt users to move Windows known folders to OneDrive." If moving the known folders silently does not succeed, users will be prompted to correct the error and continue. If you enable this setting and provide your tenant ID, you can choose whether to display a notification to users after their folders have been redirected. You can move all folders at once or select the folders you want to move. After a folder is moved, this policy will not affect that folder again, even if you clear the check box for the folder. If you disable or do not configure this setting, your users' known folders will not be silently redirected and/or moved to OneDrive. | Enabled                                                                                                                      |

| OneDrive\Silently sign in users to the OneDrive sync app with their Windows credentials                                          | This setting lets you silently sign in users to the OneDrive sync app (OneDrive.exe) with their Windows credentials. If you enable this setting, users who are signed in on the PC with the primary Windows account (the account used to join the PC to the domain) can set up the sync app without entering the credentials for the account. Users will still be shown OneDrive Setup so they can select folders to sync and change the location of their OneDrive folder. If a user is using the previous OneDrive for Business sync app (Groove.exe), the new sync app will attempt to take over syncing the user's OneDrive from the previous app and preserve the user's sync settings. This setting is frequently used together with "Set the maximum size of a user's OneDrive that can download automatically" on PCs that don't have Files On-Demand, and "Set the default location for the OneDrive folder." If you disable or do not configure this setting, users will need to sign in with their work or school account to set up sync.                                               | Enabled                                                                                                                      |

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Security Configuration (HVCI) (Optional)

Configures Memory Integrity also known as Hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI). This is enabled by default on new installs of Windows 11 22H2+ on Intel 8th gen and AMD Zen 2 or later processors. Deploying this will configure it for machines that were not newly installed with Windows 11 22H2+. This will fix the warning about Memory Integrity not being configured in Windows Security center.

Memory integrity works better with Intel Kabylake and higher processors with *Mode-Based Execution Control*, and AMD Zen 2 and higher processors with *Guest Mode Execute Trap* capabilities. Older processors rely on an emulation of these features, called *Restricted User Mode*, and will have a bigger impact on performance.

Some applications and hardware device drivers may be incompatible with memory integrity. This incompatibility can cause devices or software to malfunction and in rare cases may result in a boot failure (blue screen). Such issues may occur after memory integrity has been turned on or during the enablement process itself. If compatibility issues occur, see [Troubleshooting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/enable-virtualization-based-protection-of-code-integrity#troubleshooting) for remediation steps.

This configuration profile also configures System Guard Secure Launch which defends against firmware attacks. More info about System Guard Secure Launch can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/how-hardware-based-root-of-trust-helps-protect-windows).

Configuring both of these settings plus Bitlocker allows for the device to be configured as a [Secured-Core PC.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-highly-secure-11)

We mark this configuration profile as optional due to the hardware requirements for memory integrity. Please test this configuration on a group of devices before deploying to production. While this allows for an increased security state of the device, potential performance and driver/application compatibility issues could arise.

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Shared Cart/Lab (SharedPC)

For shared device scenarios (Carts and Labs) we recommend using SharedPC. SharedPC will provide the optimal settings for an EDU shared configuration, allowing the device to clean up stale user profiles, configure power policy settings to allow the device to wake up and allow Windows Update to install updates outside of class time, and improved performance and enhanced privacy for users.

For more information, check out the [Shared PC technical reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/shared-pc-technical) for a list of the local policies Shared PC configures.

Note that if you want to use OneDrive for Business, a custom policy needs to be configured outside of the Settings catalog. The current SharedPC configuration in the Intune UI doesn't have the OneDrive for Business sync policy available yet.

### _MSFT - EDU - Student - General Restrictions

**Student User Settings**

These settings are primarily targeted to student users to prevent them from being able to install applications via the internet, USB drive, etc. When non-student users (teachers, IT Admins) sign on to student devices, these policies will not be applied (it may take a minute or so for the policy to sync down and remove the student restrictions after signing in).

**Note: Preventing Students from installing apps**

This process leverages Smart Screen and the Windows Store app to funnel application installs to the Store, however the Store will be blocked, preventing the user from being able to install apps. All self-service application installs should go through the Company Portal. Students will be able to use the Company Portal app to install applications you've made available to them via Intune (assuming you don't have any [primary user issues](https://github.com/rbalsleyMSFT/IntuneScripts/tree/main/ChangeIntunePrimaryUser)).

Using Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) or Applocker both have their challenges. We've found using Smart Screen and blocking the store as an easy way to solve for this while preserving device usability and manageability.

### Custom

The following custom policies are imported

- [_MSFT - EDU - Device - Shared Cart/Lab Enable OneDrive for Business](https://github.com/rbalsleyMSFT/IntuneScripts/blob/main/ConfigurationProfileSettings/SettingReference.md#_msft---edu---device---shared-cartlab-enable-onedrive-for-business)
- [_MSFT - EDU - Device - Skip ESP User Status Page](https://github.com/rbalsleyMSFT/IntuneScripts/blob/main/ConfigurationProfileSettings/SettingReference.md#_msft---edu---device---skip-esp-user-status-page)
- [_MSFT - EDU - Student - Deny Admin Apps](https://github.com/rbalsleyMSFT/IntuneScripts/blob/main/ConfigurationProfileSettings/SettingReference.md#_msft---edu---student---deny-admin-apps)

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Shared Cart/Lab Enable OneDrive for Business

In Windows 11 22H2 SharedPC CSP was modified to allow for OneDrive for Business sync. Intune has yet to add this to the Shared PC settings, so for now this must be set via a custom OMA-URI setting. If you wish for your shared devices to have the ability to sync with OneDrive, you'll want to add this setting.

**Name:** Enable ODfB SharedPC
**OMA-URI:** ./Vendor/MSFT/SharedPC/EnableSharedPCModeWithOneDriveSync
**Data Type:** Boolean
**Value:** True

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Skip ESP User Status Page

The Enrollment Status Page (ESP) has three phases

- Device preparation
- Device setup
- Account setup

The Device preparation phase enrolls the device in Intune and installs the Intune Management extension which is responsible for installing Win32 apps, remediations, device inventory, and much more.

The Device setup phase applies apps and polices that are targeted to the device.

The Account setup phase does the same as the device setup phase, but for the user.

The Account setup phase can take a very long time to process, increasing the amount of time it takes for a student or end-user to be able to use the device. For profiles that are targeted to users, they generally are applied right on sign in and with minimal delay that the Account setup phase is generally not needed.

**Name:** Skip ESP User Status Page
**OMA-URI:** ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/DMClient/Provider/MS DM Server/FirstSyncStatus/SkipUserStatusPage
**Data Type:** Boolean
**Value:** True

### _MSFT - EDU - Student - Deny Admin Apps

The following settings are primarily focused on student users to prevent them from being able to run administrative apps: cmd, powershell, reg, regedit, and terminal.

**Name:** Deny Admin apps EXE

**Description:** Block selected Administrative Apps: Cmd, PS, Regedit, Registry Console Tool, and Store Installer exes (the exes that are downloaded from apps.microsoft.com that work around the Microsoft Store application being blocked)

**OMA-URI:** ./Vendor/MSFT/AppLocker/ApplicationLaunchRestrictions/IntuneEdu/EXE/Policy

**Data Type:** String (XML File)

Download XML file - https://github.com/rbalsleyMSFT/IntuneScripts/blob/main/BlockAdminApps/BlockAdminAppsEXE.xml

**Name:** Deny Microsoft Terminal

**Description:** Deny Microsoft Terminal

**OMA-URI:** ./Vendor/MSFT/AppLocker/ApplicationLaunchRestrictions/IntuneEdu/StoreApps/Policy

**Data Type:** String (XML File)

Download XML file - https://github.com/rbalsleyMSFT/IntuneScripts/blob/main/BlockAdminApps/BlockAdminAppsAppx.xml

## Remediations

Remediations have been removed in favor of using Win32 apps.

## Win32 Applications

There are two Win32 applications that we provide. One removes built-in Windows apps, the other allows for devices to run Windows update without users signing in.

* _MSFT - EDU - Device - Remove Microsoft Apps
* _MSFT - EDU - Device - Windows Update Before Initial Logon Allowed

For these two use cases, Win32 apps are preferred over Remediations due to predicability. When provisioning a new device, Win32 apps can be configured to be required via the Enrollment Status Page, whereas with Remediations, they cannot be relied on to run at a specific time (they can be scheduled to run at a specific time, however once that time passes, devices provisioned after that time can run the remediation at an indeterministic time).

Both applications are PowerShell scripts that have been converted from Remediations.

When creating the assignments for these Win32 applications, make sure under **End user notifications** to set **Hide all toast notifications.** In the event any of the Microsoft Apps get reinstalled (either due to in-place upgrade to a new version of Windows, or some other manner) the toast notification won't spawn the next time the Win32 app runs when it detects any of the apps coming back.

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Remove Microsoft Apps

This application will remove the following built-in applications. [Source of the scripts.](https://github.com/rbalsleyMSFT/IntuneScripts/tree/main/Remediations/RemoveBuiltInApps)

* "Microsoft.YourPhone"
* "Microsoft.SkypeApp"
* "Microsoft.XboxGameOverlay"
* "Microsoft.Messaging"
* "Microsoft.XboxGamingOverlay"
* "Microsoft.People"
* "Microsoft.MicrosoftOfficeHub"
* "Microsoft.BingWeather"
* "Microsoft.Microsoft3DViewer"
* "Microsoft.MicrosoftSolitaireCollection"
* "Microsoft.MixedReality.Portal"
* "microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps"
* "Microsoft.XboxApp"
* "MicrosoftTeams"
* "Microsoft.BingNews"
* "Microsoft.SurfaceHub"
* "Microsoft.GamingApp"
* "Microsoft.ZuneVideo"
* "Microsoft.OutlookForWindows"
* "Microsoft.549981C3F5F10" (this is Cortana)
* "Microsoft.Windows.DevHome"

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Windows Update Before Initial Logon Allowed

This application will allow Windows Update to be able to scan and install updates before a user signs in. This requires Windows 11 22H2+ with the 2023-04 Cumulative Update.

This is beneficial for shared carts and other scenarios where devices are provsioned and then sit with power and internet connectivity, but no user signing on for a long period of time. For example, a partner or a school district that provisions thousands of devices during the summer, puts them in a cart, ships the devices to schools, and plugs the cart in. In this scenario, if the devices are configured in our [recommended Shared device configuration](https://github.com/rbalsleyMSFT/IntuneScripts/blob/main/ConfigurationProfileSettings/SettingReference.md#_msft---edu---device---shared-cartlab-sharedpc) and have deployed this application, Shared PC would wake the device each night and the device will check for updates and install as needed. Without this application, these devices wouldn't update until a user signs in.

More information about this can be found [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-wu-settings#allow-windows-updates-to-install-before-initial-user-sign-in) The source of the scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/rbalsleyMSFT/IntuneScripts/tree/main/Remediations/UpdateBeforeInitialUserSignin).

## Update rings

There are three update rings provided

* _MSFT - EDU - Device - 1:1 Update Ring
* _MSFT - EDU - Device - Kiosk (No User Present) Update Ring
* _MSFT - EDU - Device - Shared Cart/Lab/Kiosk (User Present) Update Ring

The settings within these rings come from the guidance in the Optimizing Windows 10 Update Adoption.pdf which is part of the [Windows 10 Update Baseline](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=101056) download. Feel free to adjust as necessary.

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - 1:1 Update Ring

This update ring is intended for 1 to 1 devices for all users (faculty, staff, students). The automatic update behavior is set to Reset to default, which leverages [Intelligent Active Hours](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/update-policies#active-hours), which uses machine learning to understand when the user is active on the device and will not restart during that window.

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Kiosk (No User Present) Update Ring

For devices with no user present (typically kiosk's, digital signage, etc), update ring settings must be set differently from devices where a user is present (shared carts, labs, etc).

For these settings,we leverage the Auto install and restart at a scheduled time automatic update behavior and set that to run on the 3rd Sunday of the month at 3AM. Please adjust this to a time that makes more sense for your environment. This ring also turns off notifications, including restart warnings and doesn't set deadline settings.

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Shared Cart/Lab/Kiosk (User Present) Update Ring

For shared devices (carts, labs, etc) that have a user present, use the following update ring with [SharedPC](https://github.com/rbalsleyMSFT/IntuneScripts/blob/main/ConfigurationProfileSettings/SettingReference.md#_msft---edu---device---shared-cartlab-sharedpc). In doing so devices will wake up outside of the active hours period and install updates. If SharedPC is not configured, the power policies necessary (specifically the RTCWake) won't be configured and devices won't wake up to install updates.

## Endpoint Security | Antivirus

There are two antivirus policies provided

* _MSFT - EDU - Device - Microsoft Defender Antivirus
* _MSFT - EDU - Device - Tamper Protection Enabled (MDE Required)

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Microsoft Defender Antivirus

This policy configures the recommended settings for Defender antivirus. The goal of this policy is to align with what [Tamper Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection?view=o365-worldwide) configures. Tamper Protection requires that a customer is using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2, which is included in A5 or A5 security. For customers that are not on A5, while most of these settings are the default configuration of Defender antivirus, it's best to configure them so users cannot change them. This policy also includes additional settings not controlled by Tamper Protection.

If you do have A5, or a plan that includes MDE P2, you should deploy both this policy and the _MSFT - EDU - Device - Tamper Protection Enabled (MDE Required) policy.

| Cloud Block Level                                      | This policy setting determines how aggressive Windows Defender Antivirus will be in blocking and scanning suspicious files. Value type is integer. If this setting is on, Windows Defender Antivirus will be more aggressive when identifying suspicious files to block and scan; otherwise, it will be less aggressive and therefore block and scan with less frequency. For more information about specific values that are supported, see the Windows Defender Antivirus documentation site. NoteThis feature requires the Join Microsoft MAPS setting enabled in order to function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Default State                                                                                      |
| Cloud Extended Timeout                                 | This feature allows Windows Defender Antivirus to block a suspicious file for up to 60 seconds, and scan it in the cloud to make sure it's safe. Value type is integer, range is 0 - 50. The typical cloud check timeout is 10 seconds. To enable the extended cloud check feature, specify the extended time in seconds, up to an additional 50 seconds. For example, if the desired timeout is 60 seconds, specify 50 seconds in this setting, which will enable the extended cloud check feature, and will raise the total time to 60 seconds.

Network protection protects employees using any app from accessing phishing scams, exploit-hosting sites, and malicious content on the Internet. This includes preventing third-party browsers from connecting to dangerous sites. Value type is integer. If you enable this setting, network protection is turned on and employees can't turn it off. Its behavior can be controlled by the following options: Block and Audit. If you enable this policy with the Block option, users/apps will be blocked from connecting to dangerous domains. You will be able to see this activity in Windows Defender Security Center. If you enable this policy with the Audit option, users/apps will not be blocked from connecting to dangerous domains. However, you will still see this activity in Windows Defender Security Center. If you disable this policy, users/apps will not be blocked from connecting to dangerous domains. You will not see any network activity in Windows Defender Security Center. If you do not configure this policy, network blocking will be disabled by default. | Enabled (block mode)                                                                               |

Warning: When you enable BitLocker on a device with third party encryption, it may render the device unusable and will require reinstallation of Windows. Note: This policy takes effect only if "RequireDeviceEncryption" policy is set to 1. The format is integer. The expected values for this policy are: 1 = This is the default, when the policy is not set. Warning prompt and encryption notification is allowed. 0 = Disables the warning prompt and encryption notification. Starting in Windows 10, next major update, the value 0 only takes affect on Azure Active Directory joined devices.

"AllowStandardUserEncryption" policy is tied to "AllowWarningForOtherDiskEncryption" policy being set to "0", i.e, Silent encryption is enforced. If "AllowWarningForOtherDiskEncryption" is not set, or is set to "1", "RequireDeviceEncryption" policy will not try to encrypt drive(s) if a standard user is the current logged on user in the system. The expected values for this policy are: 1 = "RequireDeviceEncryption" policy will try to enable encryption on all fixed drives even if a current logged in user is standard user. 0 = This is the default, when the policy is not set.

This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. Changing the encryption type has no effect if the drive is already encrypted or if encryption is in progress. Choose full encryption to require that the entire drive be encrypted when BitLocker is turned on. Choose used space only encryption to require that only the portion of the drive used to store data is encrypted when BitLocker is turned on. If you enable this policy setting the encryption type that BitLocker will use to encrypt drives is defined by this policy and the encryption type option will not be presented in the BitLocker setup wizard. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the BitLocker setup wizard will ask the user to select the encryption type before turning on BitLocker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Enabled                                                       |

This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be required at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs. If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the "Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM" check box. In this mode either a password or a USB drive is required for start-up. When using a startup key, the key information used to encrypt the drive is stored on the USB drive, creating a USB key. When the USB key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable or if you have forgotten the password then you will need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive. On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 6-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both. If you enable this policy setting, users can configure advanced startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can configure only basic options on computers with a TPM. Note: If you want to require the use of a startup PIN and a USB flash drive, you must configure BitLocker settings using the command-line tool manage-bde instead of the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Enabled                                                       |

| Administrative Templates\Windows Components > Bitlocker Drive Encription > Operating System Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered                                                                                                   | This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. The "Allow certificate-based data recovery agent" check box is used to specify whether a data recovery agent can be used with BitLocker-protected operating system drives. Before a data recovery agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding data recovery agents. In "Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information" select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key. Select "Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard" to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they turn on BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you turn on BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting. In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services", choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for operating system drives. If you select "Backup recovery password and key package", both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select "Backup recovery password only," only the recovery password is stored in AD DS. Select the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives" check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds. Note: If the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives" check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated. If you enable this policy setting, you can control the methods available to users to recover data from BitLocker-protected operating system drives. If this policy setting is disabled or not configured, the default recovery options are supported for BitLocker recovery. By default a DRA is allowed, the recovery options can be specified by the user including the recovery password and recovery key, and recovery information is not backed up to AD DS. | Enabled                                                       |

If you select the "Use default recovery message and URL" option, the default BitLocker recovery message and URL will be displayed in the pre-boot key recovery screen. If you have previously configured a custom recovery message or URL and want to revert to the default message, you must keep the policy enabled and select the "Use default recovery message and URL" option. If you select the "Use custom recovery message" option, the message you type in the "Custom recovery message option" text box will be displayed in the pre-boot key recovery screen. If a recovery URL is available, include it in the message. If you select the "Use custom recovery URL" option, the URL you type in the "Custom recovery URL option" text box will replace the default URL in the default recovery message, which will be displayed in the pre-boot key recovery screen. Note: Not all characters and languages are supported in pre-boot. It is strongly recommended that you test that the characters you use for the custom message or URL appear correctly on the pre-boot recovery screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Enabled                                                       |

## Autopilot Profiles

There are two Autopilot profiles that are configured

* MSFT | EDU | Self Deploy Autopilot | Customize
* MSFT | EDU | User Driven | Customize

Both of these profiles should be customized by the IT admin to include the device name template that they wish to use.

### MSFT | EDU | Self Deploy Autopilot | Customize

This Autopilot profile creates a [Self Deploying](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/autopilot/self-deploying) profile. Self Deploying profiles are designed for shared, kiosk, or digital signage types of devices and does not require a user to be present to complete enrollment. Devices enrolled with a Self Deploying Autopilot profile do not have a primary user associated with them, which allows any user to leverage the Company Portal for self-service access to install available applications targeted to them. This is great for shared devices in carts or labs where different users sign in. Self Deploying profiles can also be used for 1:1 scenarios, however know that in these types of scenarios, self-service Bitlocker recovery key retrieval is unavailable and the user will need to contact the help desk to get their recovery key. The user will also not be able to reset, rename, or retire the device via the Company Portal on their own.

Self Deploying Autopilot profiles are the fastest way to onboard a device using Autopilot without requiring a user to sign in.

### MSFT | EDU | User Driven | Customize

This Autopilot profile creates a [User Driven](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/autopilot/user-driven) profile. User-driven profiles are great for 1:1 deployments where a single-user will be using the device. The device will be registered for the user who does the initial enrollment and will associate that user as the primary user. If a secondary user signs into the device, they will be unable to use the Company Portal for self-service application installs and other self-service actions. This is important to understand as it can cause issues when a device is reissued to another user in the organization. The device should ideally be reset or reimaged, or the primary user should be changed in Intune to the new user in order for the Company Portal to work as expected.

## Filters

There are two filters that are created.

* _MSFT - EDU - All Windows 11 Devices
* _MSFT - EDU - All Windows 10 Devices

These filters are provided so they can be used when deploying either the _MSFT - EDU - Device - Remove Widgets (Windows 11) or _MSFT - EDU - Device - Remove News and Interests (Windows 10) configuration profiles.

News and Interests and Widgets, while they may seem the same within Windows, they're managed differently. If you try to remove these in one Settings Catalog profile and you manage both Windows 10 and 11 devices, you'll find that your Windows 10 devices will report errors when disabling Widgets, and you'll find your Windows 11 devices will report errors when disabling News and Interests. To workaround this and to get clean reporting data, you'll want create two separate profiles that target your Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices.

We handle this using filters, but you can also create separate groups for Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices instead of using filters.

### _MSFT - EDU - All Windows 11 Devices

This filter uses the following rule syntax

```
(device.osVersion -startsWith "10.0.2") 
```

This filter is to be used with the _MSFT - EDU - Device - Remove Widgets (Windows 11) configration profile. When deploying it, make sure to select **Edit filter**. In the Filters flyout, select the **Include filtered devices in assignment** and select the **_MSFT - EDU - All Windows 11 Devices** filter and finally click **Select**. Next, **Review + Save** the assignment.

### _MSFT - EDU - All Windows 10 Devices

This filter uses the following rule syntax

```
(device.osVersion -startsWith "10.0.1") 
```

This filter is to be used with the _MSFT - EDU - Device - Remove News and Interests (Windows 10) configration profile. When deploying it, make sure to select **Edit filter**. In the Filters flyout, select the **Include filtered devices in assignment** and select the **_MSFT - EDU - All Windows 10 Devices** filter and finally click **Select**. Next, **Review + Save** the assignment.

## Enrollment Status Page

There is one Enrollment Status Page that gets configured

* _MSFT - EDU - Device - Enrollment Status Page

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Enrollment Status Page

This enrollment status page is optional, and may even be duplicitive in your environment if you already have an ESP configured. This is included mainly for new tenants.

You may want to adjust the **Block device use until required apps are installed if they are assigned to the user/device** to **Selected** if you have a lot of applications to install. If you're building a custom image that contains most of your apps and Intune isn't deploying much, this option could slow down the overall deployment time (this is especially true in large EDU deployments that happen right before the school year). If that's the case, chose Selected and select one application that shouldn't take too long. For example, you could select the _MSFT - EDU - Device - Remove Microsoft Apps Win32 app which has a small payload size and shouldn't take too long to run.

You may wonder why have an ESP at all if I have all of my application content in my image. The reason for that is to be able to monitor the status of the deployment. If the deployment fails to enroll to Entra ID or Intune, you wouldn't know that without the ESP until you attempted to sign into the device. And if it joined successfully to Entra ID, but failed to enroll to Intune, you may not realize this until the user has been using the device for sometime.
